# **SatisfactionLevel0: A Machine Learning Project for Job Satisfaction Prediction**

## **Overview**
The **SatisfactionLevel0** project applies machine learning techniques to predict job satisfaction using real-world data. It involves exploring datasets, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building predictive models. Key objectives include improving model performance through iterative processes like hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

This project is part of the **Data & A.I. 5** course and demonstrates practical applications of machine learning concepts.
